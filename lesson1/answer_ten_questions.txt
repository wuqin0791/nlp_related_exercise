0. Can you come up out 3 sceneraies which use AI methods?
Ans: 
1.chat robot
2.anti-fraud
3.blockchain

1. How do we use Github; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;
Ans: we can git clone from Github, and then commit the change. Finally, push to the remote adress. if there are some changes from the remote, we just do the pull to update the local storage.
Jupyter and Pycharm are integrated environment, so that it will save much more time, coz most of the packages will not install seperately. At the same time, it can generate mathmatics formula by its own syntax.

2. What's the Probability Model?
Ans: It is a mathmatical problem, more specificly, equal the probability of case A over the whole case S.

3. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Probability Model?
Ans: Calculate the biologocal problem, such as infectious disease.

4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?
Ans: In our course, there is no way to check which sentence is right or not in the n-gram. Only can be judged by the probability.
I cannot answer the following question.

5. What's the Language Model;
Ans:
Language Model is probability distributed over a sequence of words, such as P(W1···Wn)

6. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Language Model?
Ans: In 2-gram, we will calculate the count of appearance of word and next word over count of appearance of the next word

7. What's the 1-gram language model;
Ans: p(w1,w2,w3···wn), which means p(w1)*p(w2)*p(w3)···p(Wn)

8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;
Ans:  

9. What't the 2-gram models;
Ans: Calculate the count of appearance of word and next word over count of appearance of the next word.

1. What's the model? why all the models are wrong, but some are useful? (5 points)
Model is just driven by some kinds of data, not the whole data to represent it. And the model is just an abstract of the real life.
However, some models are usefull, because it can predict value in life closely, although it is not accurate.

2. What's the underfitting and overfitting? List the reasons that could make model overfitting or underfitting. (10 points)
underfitting: when accurate rate of the model is obviously under the real accurate rate, we call it underfitting. which happens that the model is to simple, has fewer parameters to represent.
overfitting: In the training data, accurate rate of the model is obviously very high, but in the testing data it shows different low accurate rate.
There are serveral reasons to result it:
1. model is too complex
2. the range of data set is too small
3. the distribution of data is not very well
4. the value of the parameter is too big

3. What's the precision, recall, AUC, F1, F2score. What are they mainly target on? (12')
precision = tp /(tp + fp)  => 计算满足要求正确值占总值的比率
recall = tp / (tp + fn) => 计算满足要求正确值占满足要求正确值+不满足目标的错误值
tp =  true positive 
fp = false positive
fn = false nagative

F1_score = 2*(precision * recall) / (precision + recall) => 同时考虑到两个点

AUC： area under curve，用来计算精准度，因为精确度越高，auc的曲线斜率越大。


4. Based on our course and yourself mind, what's the machine learning? (8')
In tradition way, we can define a function precisely, but machine learning is totally different.

Machine learning is a model driven by data. The form of parameters are calculated by data for many times of iteration.
design the function with calculated parameters.


5. "正确定义了机器学习模型的评价标准(evaluation)， 问题基本上就已经解决一半". 这句话是否正确？你是怎么看待的？ (8‘)
因为机器学习就是通过不停的迭代计算，算出模型的参数，从而不断的完善。迭代是有目标的，不是任意的参数都可以的。所以一旦有了目标，机器学习就有了方向，也就知道如何评价模型是优还是良。
